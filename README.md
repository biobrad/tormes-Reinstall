# tormes-Reinstall

The tormes reinstall script was created to install a clean version of tormes if you are having issues with your current environment of tormes.
The install normally includes the download of an 8 Gig database for Kraken.

This script saves the existing Kraken database and skips that step on the re-install to save a lot of time in the re-install process.
